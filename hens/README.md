# Performance effects of greedily calculated big-M constraints on exact models for heat recovery network synthesis

## Introduction
Heat Exchanger Network Synthesis (HENS) is one of the most important tasks in power, refining and chemical industries as well as emerging industries derived from environmental engineering. HENS is used in every process design as it has proven to be useful for reducing a process cost and increasing operability and controllability. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art algorithmic methods for HENS cannot solve moderately large problem instances as it constitutes a NP-Hard problem in the strong sense. The computational bottleneck of this task is the minimum number of matches optimization problem which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization problem with big-M parameters. Commonly, these big-M parameters represent an additional layer of complexity if they are not tightly calculated, but an exact computation of them is time consuming and mostly requires solving the initial optimization problem first to obtain the precise values. I explore in this work a tighter computation of these parameters compared to traditional methods by using a greedy algorithm in order to perform the calculation swiftly as it is needed. Fifteen benchmark instances of HENS were solved using both the transportation and transshipment models with their big-M parameters calculated both in the trivial traditional manner and with the proposed greedy algorithm. The experimental results show that in complex HENS problem instances, the greedy proposed big-M parameters outperform the ones calculated trivially.
